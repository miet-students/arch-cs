"cc"
The "cc" clobber indicates that the assembler code modifies the flags register. On some machines, GCC represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register; "cc" serves to name this register. On other machines, condition code handling is different, and specifying "cc" has no effect. But it is valid no matter what the target.
